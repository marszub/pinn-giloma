# PINN approximation of brain tumor growth and therapy
Initial condition was given using quadratic function.
![Initial condition](./resources/therapy/initial_condition.png)
Therapy factor indicates what fraction of tumor cells die per day. Chart below presents its value in over simulation tine.

Therapy indeed makes difference to simulated tumor size. Animations below show giloma growth without therapy and with it.
